Summary: Brief description of topics in course and link to code on GitHub

In November 2017, I fired up my PC and enrolled myself in Andrew Ng's very popular [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on [Coursera](http://coursera.org). He teaches this as a course at Stanford; however, the Stanford version utilizes python/numpy while the Coursera version uses Octave. In this blog post, I will link to my repository which has all the solved problems for the course. I will also attempt to explain some of the concepts in an effort to rehash topics long forgotten.
